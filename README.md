This course covered different data structures such as binary trees, hash tables, and linked lists, as well as their appropriate uses. I strove to understand the pros and cons of each data structure and use them when their advantages were greater than their disadvantages. I resolved the problems by referring to the method's official documentation and studying sample uses. Sometimes, I created a simple prototype code component that I later broadened as the complexity of the logic grew. The assessment of big-O led to a thorough examination of performance and factors in designing algorithms. This shows a deficiency in recursive thinking, which restricts some aspects of my design capacity. All these components originate from practical experience. I have created a basic function that acts as a model for all of my different file stream designs. I might think about turning some commonly used elements into libraries for future use.
